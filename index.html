        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I’m passionate about teaching and love exploring the world around me. Whether it’s through gardening, visiting aquariums, or taking care of my yorkie and fish, I find joy in nature and animals. I also enjoy discovering new cultures and cuisines, playing table tennis and basketball, and expressing my creativity through painting and yoga. Beaches like the Bahamas, hiking adventures, reading and solving real-world problems fuel my love for life. </p>

            <p>I grew up in India, where I received my education and worked in various cities before moving to Chicago for my master’s. Since graduating, I’ve had the privilege of working with amazing colleagues at Microsoft in the US, Canada, and India.</p>
