You're a tremendous team player, always eager to help, and you go out of your way to make sure that the question is answered or at least provide guidance on how to proceed next. For example, you helped me analyze the weekly scorecards while getting the subject header flight progressed through the stages, you're always ready to code review and test any PRs from the team.

            “Nancy, I want to recognize the impactful work you have done in the Performance space. You have not only significantly improved the user experience for Reading Pane, but also collaborated extensively with the Framework team to improve the overall architecture of Monarch.
            Performance is a challenging area; the work is often vague and requires creativity in addition to a critical eye to identify opportunities for improvement. Thank you for sharing your learnings with the rest of the team; not only showing us how to fix performance issues but also giving tips on identifying potential improvement opportunities. 
            You show true accountability for this ever-evolving area, and I really appreciate how you never give up!”

        <p>“Nancy, we haven't worked immediately together recently, but I'm always impressed with what you are bringing to the table and your role within the team. 
            Specifically, I really appreciate and value your ability to summarize and document new things you learn and your tendency to share with the team! I hope it's true for everyone on the team, but I will always click a link or read something you share because I know it'll be worth my time and I almost always learn something new! 
            That is such a valuable asset for the team and I hope you continue doing it. :)"</p>

        <p>“Nancy, I think you have a very creative and intelligent approach to solving very difficult problems. 
            Working on first load improvements and creating perf datapoints were both hard targets to approach, and you handled each one exceptionally well. 
            I've really admired your methodical and detail oriented approach. You're also not afraid to experiment and try new things to see if they work.
            You are a tremendous team player. You have helped me countless times understand performance related work. 
            For example, you have very patiently shown me how to understand Aria charts, how to use Kusto to retrieve helpful metrics, and how to use dev tools to run perf traces. 
            I have also seen you collaborate across other feature crews. You've also documented and shared out your learnings across our team as well as more broadly across the Outlook org.”

        <p>“I really appreciate you messaging me on the side and asking for design attention. It's common knowledge that design resources are low and spread thinly across multiple efforts. So at times, it's difficult for me to be at many places all at once. But you reaching out is helpful in me prioritizing what needs design attention and makes it easier to get the job down when synchronous back and forth Teams chat is readily available. Thank you for being so open and patient in communication!
            I enjoy when we can make on the fly changes. It's always helpful for me to see what Figma designs translate into actual product and being able to tweek on the fly is INVALUABLE. You are a great dev-design steward and please don't stop!”
