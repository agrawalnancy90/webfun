						<p class="date">July 2018 - Present</p>
						<p class="ptype">Hobby Project</p>
						<p class="description">
							Version 1 live on Google Play Store. It is a classic tic-tac-toe game based on Harry Potter theme. 
							You get to choose whether you start the game as a muggle or as a witch / wizard. If you lose a game, Moaning Myrtle annoys you with her moan. 
							If you win, you get assigned to a new house (Griffindor / Hufflepuff / Slytherin / Ravenclaw) and you earn points for your current house. 
						</p>
						<p>This app gives a magical experience along with a classic game.</p>

						<p class="description">Implemented and tested this Android app as part of a Software Engineering class project in a team of four. We used the Agile methodology for this project.The Food Allergen Detector is a prototype app to demonstrate the functionality of the final mobile app that aims at providing an interface to users for scanning food items and purchasing them only if they are allergen-free.</p>
						<p>We also designed a virual reality project called 'Mind Palace' using Waterfall model and following the Software Development Life Cycle.</p>

						<h3>Projects Using the First General-Purpose Object-Oriented Language</h3>
						<p class="date">October 2018</p>
						<p class="ptype">Course Projects (Object Oriented Languages and Environment)</p>
						<p class="description">Smalltalk is a pure object oriented language (unlike C++) which is great for building prototypes due to its OO features - it's dynamincally typed which means you can bind any object to any type of identifier (like in Python). It is garbage collected, so you do not have to worry about deallocating memory (like Java). It has single inheritance (like C# and Java and unlike Python) which means you do not have to worry about identifier conflicts of data members and methods inherited from multiple classes. Identifiers are only references (like Java) so we don't have to deal with the complexities introduced by value identifiers. It is interpreted (like Python) so you don't need to save separate files for tiny test code snippets... just write it on the IDE and the interpreter gives the effect of the code on each line right away. And, it's a really small language! Plus, it provides you a GUI! </p><p>This is a screenshot borrowed from Prof. Ugo Buy's slides depicting the spectrum of object oriented languages.</p>

				<div class="more-projects"> <b>C++ Projects:</b>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Music Library Service: </b>The service maintains a set of audio files containing a large number of songs and delivers a music file upon demand from a service user. These music clips are stored in files most of the time and are dynamically read into memory using smart pointers.</li>
						<li><b>Programmable Calculator: </b>Supports branching, assignment and mathematical expressions in the program. Also provides debugging functionality.</li>

						<h3>Simplified WAR: An Online Card Game</h3>
						<p class="date">March 2018</p>
						<p class="ptype">Course Project (Introduction to Networking)</p>
						<p class="description">Implemented a cross-platform server that can handle multiple requests simultaneously (tested for 1000 simultaneous requests) and a client for a very simple stateful network protocol. The war server listens for new TCP connections on a given port. It waits until two clients have connected to that port. Once both have connected, the game starts and continues until each player has sent all of their cards and received all of their play results; after receiving the last play result, the clients disconnect; after sending the last play result, the server also disconnects.This was implemented in Python and multiple games were handled using the asyncio library.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="more-projects"> <b>Other Networking Projects:</b> Investigated network traffic using Wireshark; implemented a barebones HTTP/1.1 client, a recursive DNS resolver and a reliable communication over an unreliable link, just like TCP.</div>

						<h3>Console Driver and Graphics Driver</h3>
						<p class="date">October 2017</p>
						<p class="ptype">Course Project (Operating Systems)</p>
						<p class="description">Extended the existing console device driver in XV6 OS to support colored text. Also created a brand new device driver for graphics display. These projects were implemented using C and Assembly Language.</p>

						<br>
						<h3>Splash Screen Boot Sector</h3>
						<p class="date">September 2017</p>
						<p class="ptype">Course Project (Operating Systems)</p>
						<p class="description">Created a splash screen boot sector using BIOS services. This involved creating a "disk" containing the boot sector and the picture to be shown; waiting for the user to press a key, and outputting text on the console; changing the video mode and palette settings; reading an image from disk into memory and producing a nice-looking, alternative picture to display, in the right format.</p>
					</div>  
				</div>
				<div class="more-projects"> <b>Other extensions to XV6 OS:</b> Added system calls like <b>mmap()</b> for memory mapping, <b>dedup()</b> for implementing a dedplication system wherein the kernel scans the system for duplicated pages and frees up memory by reusing identical physical memory page frames in several virtual memory locations. Added support for kernel threads to allow multi-threading by introducing thread management and association with processes and implementing system calls like <b>sys_clone()</b>, <b>thread_exit()</b>, <b>process_exit()</b>, <b>thread_join()</b> and <b>exec()</b>. Added support for standard Unix signals. Added the /proc file system.</div>

							<ul><li>Time - Automate organization of daily task-lists and send reminders based on time.</li>
								<li>Location - Create geofences for locations related to task and send reminders when user enters the geofence.</li>
								<li>Social - Share task with friends. Update task-list of every member of the group having that task on their list on its completion.</li></ul>
