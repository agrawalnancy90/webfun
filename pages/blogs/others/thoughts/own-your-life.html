    		A girl was once married, mistreated, even beaten by her in-laws in spite of doing her best. She was in pain and yet silent about it. She did not utter a word about it to her family, just wrote it down. . . in a diary that became her only companion because nobody else would understand what she was going through. It was found after her death. Nobody knows how she died. Nobody besides her family cares. Why would anybody bother to find out anything about an ordinary uneducated girl? Believe it or not, such stories are real and happen every day even in this era! 
		</p>

			Even in the twenty first century, women in India have to deal with problems that developed countries overcame more than a century ago. For starters, it is EVERYBODY'S business if a girl is not married by the age of twenty-five. Attend any social gathering and there will be a couple of long-nosed aunties and uncles who will comment on a girl's being single (and mind it, being single is equivalent to being unmarried as love-relationships do not count in this narrow-minded society). Another word they use is, "not settled" even if they are running a successful business or earning loads from a great job. They will comment about it right there on the girl's face. No concept of rude vs polite! The only thing that is counted rude is questioning elders no matter how insane their demands are! Girls, here's a request to you with all my heart and soul - "Please do not flow with this logic-less and stupid tide. Have the courage to question such elders. What are you really afraid of? These peekers have nothing better to do than poke their long noses into your life. Do you think it matters what they think or say about you? Do you think they are even worth it? If what I am requesting sounds provoking or against your values, and let's say this uncle/aunt really cares about you, then they would also respect your say in the matter. There's nothing to lose here. You are either getting rid of such comments, or changing someone's mindset for good. And once questioned, they will think multiple times before harrassing anyone else. Just a little fire inside you can lead to a better society. It is your life and your business when you want to get married."

			When married, no matter how educated or successful the girl is in her career, she will be forced to leave her family and live with her in-laws while the guy gets to enjoy his career, his own family, a wife who cooks for him, cleans his dirty underwear, bears his kids, takes care of his entire family and ONLY IF ALLOWED, works on her own career too. Hats off to all the ladies for bearing so much and yet being rebuked and taunted day-in and day-out by the same family for which they were forced to leave their own!    
		</p>

		<p>
			While I applaud their strength, courage, patience and tolerance for all that they bear, I also blame them to some extent for lacking the fire within. Why would a person sacrifice so much and yet quietly listen to criticism in spite of doing their best? Clearly, they are either afraid or too tired of trying. Another possibility is that they enjoy being an epitome of sacrifice (I would love to meet some such women and try to understand their psychology). 
		</p>

			Most women go through this pain all their lives out of fear of hurting their family's reputation in society in case their rebellion leads to a divorce. But who is this monster called society? Last I checked, it was us! We make up the society. We are it. Anybody who resonates with this article, pledge to yourselves - "The next time I hear about a divorce, I will have sympathy for both parties involved and not judge them. The divorce only means that the people involved were not meant to be together. Just like a bad decision in any other matter. If I make a bad choice, it doesn't mean I should stick with it and mess up my whole life for it. This is nothing but a similar situation. I will not judge them and instead help them in their tough time if I can." If you are a parent, be your daughter's strength and not her weakness. She is bearing it all for your happiness without realizing that her happiness is what matters the most to you in the world. Do not let the daughters in this country be abused. To the women who are afraid of taking their stand, I would like to say this - "YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Remember this and you will start feeling empowered right away. Seek help. Talk to people you can confide in. Shoot me an email without giving away any private details and I will be your friend. Sometimes it's just you who might be thinking negatively about your situation. Give it your best analysis and rectify your thoughts. After all this is done, if you still feel things are not right, remind yourself that you have only one life. Rethink if you want to just waste it away living like this or will taking a stand be a better choice. Love yourself first. We girls tend to forget the importance of loving ourselves first. Life is meant to have fun and not waste away on crying and making sacrifices for someone who doesn't even respect you. Happiness is yours, just claim it!"

			In many cases, kids become the reason for tolerating the injustice. The woman does not want her children to have a future without a father. But how can the kids have a good future living in such an unhealthy family environment? Rethink! In other cases, the victim is not capable of supporting herself financially. For this, we need to educate our daughters. Every individual in the country needs to be self-dependent. We need to respect every life irrespective of their gender.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is another important angle to this problem, and probably the most important one - the victims becoming criminals themselves. These women who patiently tolerate all the nonsense start getting comfortable with it over time. They become institutionalized and think that it is just how things are supposed to be. These same women tell their sons not to learn cooking because apparantly it is a girl's job. They interfere in every aspect of their son's life and try to find a daughter-in-law whom they can tame and treat like a maid. They start behaving as if they are pathetically old even at the age of fifty and helpless without them. These same women interfere in their brother's life and comment on every possible aspect of his wife's personality. To such women I really have nothing to say... If they cannot learn from their own struggles, words will not enter such dumb heads. To those still in the process of becoming criminals from victims - "Please don't do to others what you would not like being done to you." 
		</p>

		<p>
			If someone is taking the liberty to throw commands on you as they please, and you are letting them do it even though it is totally against your will and values, thinking that it is required for peace, just think again! You and your choices are being disrespected and you are letting that happen. Your passive nature in this regard is doing more harm than you can imagine. While it might lead to temporary peace in your family or whatever situation you are in, you not only empowered that someone to continue oppressing you, but also contributed to an unfair society. 

		</p>

		<p>
			Nobody in this world has the right to tell you how to live your life. You have only one life, own it. Take control over it.
