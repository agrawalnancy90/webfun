			<h2>Content Migration from Drupal to WordPress</h2>
			<p class="small-italics center">Posted on <time datetime="2018-09-03">October 25th, 2018</time> by Nancy Agrawal</p>
			<p> Moving information from one system to another can be an overwhelming process, especially when it has a lot of content. Besides, it involves several options and each of those choices comes with its own challenges.
			</p>

			<p> This blog intends to make one such use case easy for you: Move content from a Drupal 7 CMS to WordPress 4.9.
			</p>
			<p>
			The content migration process involves three major steps:
				<ul>
					<li>Knowing what to migrate.</li>
					<li>Exporting it from the current system.</li>
					<li>Importing it into the new system.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3>Knowing What You Want to Move</h3>
			<p>The first step in migrating your content is to decide what pages and related information you would want to move to your new system. This also involves understanding how content is organized in your current CMS and how it appears when moved to the new system. You would have to make several design decisions at this point. Let us follow this with an example: 
			</p>

			<p>Knowing my goal, I first explored how Drupal stores its content. I looked at both, the backend database, and the admin dashboard on my website. My Drupal database had more than 300 tables! Yours can vary depending on what modules are active on your Drupal CMS. But do not be overwhelmed by it. Most of these tables contain metadata on how your content is structured, access and revision history etc., and not the actual content itself. Drupal stores its content as nodes. For categorizing content and its better management, the authors / editors / administrators may choose to organize their content into different types of nodes. This can be seen in the ‘Type’ field of drupal_node table. For a non-technical user, it can be seen on the dashboard too.
			</p>

			<p>On the Drupal dashboard, go to Content → Add Content.

				<span class="small-italics">Figure 1: Different content types in Drupal CMS</span>
				</figure>
				Here you can see all the different types of nodes that your CMS uses to store the content. Figure 1 shows a custom content type - ‘Answer’ that is specific to my website. You can have several others on yours. You might want to list all the content types available on your Drupal instance to plan which type goes where in your new system.
			</p>

			<p>
				Click on any one of those types. You can now see the different fields that go in the selected content type. Figure 2 shows some of the fields for content type ‘Answer’. 
				<figure><img class="center-image" src="../../../assets/images/create_answer.png" width="80%"><br>
				<span class="small-italics">Figure 2: Create content of a particular type.</span>
				</figure>
			</p>

			<p>This step is useful to list down all the fields that you might want to export for a node type. An alternative approach is to go to dashboard, click on content, select the node type and click apply. This lists some of the existing content of the selected type.

			<span class="small-italics">Figure 3: Select a particular content type.</span>
			</figure>
			You can now select edit (from operations column as shown in figure 4). This gives a better idea of what goes in each field of the content type.

			<span class="small-italics">Figure 4: List of some existing content of selected type.</span>
			</figure>
			You can also select one of the content items from the list as shown in Figure 4 to see how this content appears on your current site (Figure 5).

			<span class="small-italics">Figure 5: Sample of how the content type appears on the site.</span>
			</figure>
			</p>

			<p>
				Before proceeding to the next step, it might be useful to note down all the fields related to each content type that you wish to migrate.
			</p>

			<h3>Exporting Content from Drupal</h3>
			<p>Now that you know what you want to migrate, you can export your content using a Drupal module called <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/views_data_export" target="_blank">“Views Data Export”</a>. It lets you export large amounts of data in different formats. I worked with CSV and XML, and found XML to be easier to handle as it worked better with the third step - importing into WordPress.
			</p>

			<p>First, install and activate the module Views data export on your Drupal instance. You might have to install some other modules as well that are required by this module. Installing modules in Drupal 7 has been covered <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/extend/installing-modules" target="_blank">here</a> comprehensively.
			</p>

			<p>Check in your modules that Views Data Export is active. If not, mark the check box next to it and click ‘Save Configuration’.

				<span class="small-italics">Figure 6: Active Views Modules</span>
			</figure>
			</p>

			<p>Now go to dashboard → Structure → Views → Add New View.

				<span class="small-italics">Figure 8: Add new view fields.</span>
			</figure>
			</p>

			<p>Enter view name: Export Demo. Select Description and add description if you like. Unselect the checkbox next to Create a page. This shrinks the options and leaves us with only what we need.
			<figure><img class="center-image" src="../../../assets/images/add_view2.png" width="80%"><br>
				<span class="small-italics">Figure 9: Only relevant options.</span>
			</figure>
			</p>

			<p>The drop-down of ‘Show’ contains several options. In this blog, we will only explore Content. Other options can be selected and worked upon in the same way. Select ‘of type’ from the drop-down. I am exporting the content type ‘Answers’ for this demo. You can even select a particular tag. For example, if you have some pages which are tagged with the term ‘service’ and you are interested in exporting only those pages, then you enter ‘service’ in the ‘tagged-with’ field. Now select ‘Continue &amp; edit’. 
			<figure><img class="center-image" src="../../../assets/images/add_view3.png" width="80%"><br>
				<span class="small-italics">Figure 10: Select content type and Continue &amp; edit.</span>
			</figure>

			<figure><img class="center-image" src="../../../assets/images/add_view4.png" width="80%"><br>
				<span class="small-italics">Figure 11: Export Demo screen with changes not saved yet.</span>
			</figure>	
			</p>

			<p>You will see a warning at the top of this screen saying “All changes are saved temporarily”. Whenever you make any changes, you should click on ‘Save’ on the top right corner of this screen, otherwise the changes are lost when you refresh the page. At the bottom of this screen, you will see an option with Auto-preview checked. Uncheck it for faster processing. Whenever you want a preview, you can click on Update preview.

				<span class="small-italics">Figure 12: Uncheck Auto preview for faster processing.</span>
			</figure>
			</p>

			<p>Now click on Add and select Data export from the drop-down.
			<figure><img class="center-image" src="../../../assets/images/add_view6.png" width="80%"><br>
				<span class="small-italics">Figure 13: Add Data export view.</span>
			</figure>
			<figure><img class="center-image" src="../../../assets/images/add_view7.png" width="80%"><br>
				<span class="small-italics">Figure 14: Added Data export view.</span>
			</figure>
			</p>

			<p>We are now ready to set the required export configuration. First, we select XML format by clicking on CSV file and selecting XML from the options. Check the box ‘Provide as file’ and give a filename. Click Apply.
